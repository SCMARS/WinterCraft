# WinterCraft 2025 Assets

This directory contains all the static assets for the WinterCraft 2025 website.

## Images and Gallery

This site is configured to use images from `public/gallery` by default. We copied the provided “ChatGPT Image … .png” files into that folder with clean names:

- `public/gallery/hero-1.png`
- `public/gallery/hero-2.png`
- `public/gallery/hero-3.png`
- `public/gallery/hero-4.png`
- `public/gallery/gallery-1.png`
- `public/gallery/gallery-2.png`

Pages reference these images for hero sections and cards. You can replace them with your own assets by dropping files into `public/gallery` and updating paths in the page components if desired.

### Optional
- `favicon.ico` – add your favicon here

## Image Guidelines

- Optimize for web (PNG or JPG, compressed)
- Prefer winter/Minecraft-inspired visuals for consistency
- Keep visual style cohesive across pages
